# What is a startup? 
A startup is an innovative company in its early stages with significant growth potential, typically in the technology sector. The term "startup" implies rapid progression and accelerated development during the early phases of a business enterprise.   
Essentially, the concept of a startup entails creating and implementing an innovative business strategy that is repeatable and scalable. In other words, a startup seeks inventive and unusual solutions to a specific problem or need, with the ability to scale quickly without proportionally increasing its costs.   
For example, opening a clothing store does not qualify as a startup because it is a classic and well-established business concept. However, developing an e-commerce platform focusing in fashion that uses personalized recommendation algorithms could be deemed a startup because it combines technology and innovation to provide a unique market solution.
