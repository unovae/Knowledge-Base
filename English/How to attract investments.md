## Developing a Strong Business Plan

The foundation of attracting investors lies in a well-written business plan. It should showcase the project’s mission, vision, unique value proposition, revenue model, market analysis, financials, competitive advantage, and most importantly, ROI. The executive summary should be the most revised part as it will be the only part of the business plan which will surely be read by the investors.

## Defining the Problem and the Solution

Not all investors might be well-versed in the field or market you are targeting, so therefore you need to effectively breakdown the problem, understand and explain the pain points of your customer, and demonstrate how your solution will be the best option for them.

Choose what type of investor you need such as angel investors, venture capitalists, government fundings, or private equity firms.

## Identifying the Right Investors

By understanding the nature of your project’s needs, you can decide what would be the right investor for you. Research investor profiles and find out which ones are more interested in your field and potential market. Choose what type of investor you need.

### Types of Investors

- **Angel Investors:** Wealthy individuals who are willing to invest in start-ups at an early stage in return for equity in the company. They usually are motivated and are willing to help the entrepreneurs whom they invested in as their own money is on the line. You can find them usually in Angel Investor circles or groups such as [Angelist](https://www.angellist.com/) or [Gust](https://gust.com/). Attending Industry events can also help you find them.

- **Crowdfunding:** A way to raise funds for a specific cause or project by asking a large number of people to donate money. It can be either for charitable causes where money is raised as donations or businesses seeking capital sell ownership stakes online in the form of equity or debt. Platforms like [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/en-gb) and [Fundly](https://fundly.com/)  are the prime examples of this category.

- **Venture Capitalists:** Private equity firms that invest in early-stage startups that demonstrate high potential for growth in return for equity in the company and participation of managerial activities and decisions. Unlike angel investors which usually can give investments based on ideas, venture capitalists are more rigorous and demanding on proof of concept and managerial decisions. Some of the famous Venture Capitalist firms are  [Andreessen Horowitz](https://a16z.com/) and  [Sequoia Capital](https://www.sequoiacap.com/).

- **Government Funding:** Grants funds to startups in various forms. It can be a direct grant, loans, or material provision such as land required or IT solutions for cheap. Many grants are also given to the R&D sector or generally to the companies that help develop solutions in the best interests of the government policies. One famous example of government funding is the [SBA Loan](https://www.sba.gov/funding-programs/loans) in the United States.

## Financials

Show the investors a clear financial plan and emphasize the return of investment potential. Make realistic financial projections, including revenue forecasts, expense breakdowns, and expected profitability. Present a detailed plan for utilizing the funds effectively and outline potential exit strategies for investors. Show the traction gained to substantiate your claim of developing the solution.

## Utilizing Your Connections

Leverage your personal and professional contacts to find potential investors. Attend events, join communities, and participate in various entrepreneurial challenges to further widen your network.

## Market Your Team’s Ability

Experienced investors and entrepreneurs understand this well that ideas are not the most crucial factor of success in start-ups, but rather the team’s ability of execution. Moreover, the investors would more likely trust and put their money on experienced individuals with proven track record.

## Demonstrate Proof of Concept

Showcasing a functional MVP (minimum viable product) or a prototype may increase the chances of getting investment by decreasing the investor risk. Provide testimonials, reviews, or results achieved by it to demonstrate market acceptance.

## Craft a Captivating Pitch

Create a pitch which should be concise, informative, and appealing. Keep the investors engaged by any means such as interactive elements. It should include all the essential elements of the business plan. Tailor the pitch according to the interests of the investors.

## Conclusion

Attracting investors is a complicated journey that can be traveled by focused planning, preparation, and execution. By following the tips given above while being transparent and honest not only to the investors, but more importantly to your team and yourself, the chances of securing right investments can be significantly increased. Finally, giving a hundred percent, believing in yourself, and persistence is the key, as Steve Jobs famously said: "I'm convinced that about half of what separates the successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance".
